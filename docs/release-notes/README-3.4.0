Configuration Changes
---------------------

See config.TEMPLATE.inc.php for a description and examples of all supported
configuration parameters.

- The date/time formats in config.inc.php should be converted from the format
  specified in https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php to the format
  specified in https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php. If you're not
  sure how, use the values below. The following settings are affected:
    date_format_short = "Y-m-d"
    date_format_long = "F n, Y"
    datetime_format_short = "Y-m-d h:i A"
    datetime_format_long = "F n, Y - h:i A"
    time_format = "h:i A"
  The old formats will continue to work for now but are deprecated.

- An allowed_hosts option was added to protect against HOST injection attacks.
  We recommend configuring this setting! See "Recommended Configuration" in
  docs/README.md for details. (https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/7649)

- The captcha.captcha_on_login option for displaying a captcha challenge in
  the login interface has been added (default: on)

- The setting i18n.client_charset was removed. It used to support two options "ISO-8859-1" (LATIN1) and "UTF-8", now we're UTF-8 only.

New config.inc.php section for queues was added, with the following parameters:
    - default_connection (default value: database), being the default queue driver to be used;
    - default_queue (default value: queue), being the default queue to be used if someone forgot to associate a queue during Queue::push()
    - disable_jobs_run_at_shutdown (default value: off), being a flag to disable the jobs to run at php shutdown

New config.inc.php section "logging" was added, with the following parameters:
    - path: Path to store the log. If empty, the PHP's error_log will be used.
    - level: Defines the minimum level of messages that you are interested to keep. The default value is debug (all messages).
      Possible values are: emergency, alert, critical, error, warning, notice, info and debug.

- The setting email.log_path was added to configure where email logs should be stored.
- The setting email.log_level was added to define the minimum level of messages that should be kept.
